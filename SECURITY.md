# Security Policy

## Introduction
The Orrery project team and community take the security of our software and systems seriously. The security of our users' data and the integrity of our codebase are our highest priorities. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the community in helping us maintain a safe and secure ecosystem.

This document outlines our policy for reporting security vulnerabilities. We are committed to working with the community to verify, reproduce, and respond to legitimate reports.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or social media.**

We believe in responsible disclosure. Publicly disclosing a vulnerability can put the entire community at risk before a solution is available.

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in any Orrery repository or service, please report it to us privately. This gives us the opportunity to investigate and address the issue without exposing users to unnecessary risk.

To report a vulnerability, please send a detailed email to orrery.techeco@gmail.com.

### What to Include in Your Report
To help us investigate and resolve the issue as quickly as possible, please include the following details in your report:

* **A clear description of the vulnerability:** What is the issue, and what is its potential impact?
* **The repository and specific file/location:** Where in the codebase does the vulnerability exist?
* **Steps to reproduce:** Provide a clear, step-by-step guide on how to trigger the vulnerability.
* **Proof-of-concept (PoC):** If possible, include a small script or code snippet that demonstrates the issue.
* **Any suggested mitigations:** If you have ideas on how to fix the issue, please share them.

## Disclosure Policy
Our goal is to be transparent about vulnerabilities once they have been addressed.
1. **Confirmation:** Upon receiving a vulnerability report, we will send an initial confirmation to the reporter within 48-72 hours.
2. **Investigation & Remediation:** We will work to investigate the issue and develop a patch. We will maintain an open line of communication with the reporter during this time.
3. **Public Disclosure:** Once a patch is developed and ready for release, we will coordinate with the reporter on a public disclosure. We aim to credit the reporter for their discovery, unless they prefer to remain anonymous.

We will not engage in legal action against individuals who submit vulnerability reports through our private, responsible disclosure process.

## Safe Harbor
We consider security research and vulnerability reporting activities conducted under this policy to be authorized and beneficial to our community. We will not initiate legal action against you for circumventing technological measures to conduct research, provided that your research is conducted in good faith and does not compromise the privacy or security of our users or the stability of our systems.

Thank you for helping keep the Orrery project and its community safe.
