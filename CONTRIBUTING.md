Thank you for your interest in contributing to Orrery! This project is in its very early stages (Phase 1). Right now, the best way to contribute is by joining the discussion in our Discord, providing feedback on the White Paper, and engaging with our community. We are not yet accepting code contributions, but we are actively looking for collaborators to help shape our first proof-of-concept, the 'Gravity' shell. Stay tuned for updates!
